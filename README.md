# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Atari Games

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for playing Atari games. The DQN algorithm, introduced by Mnih et al. in the paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf), combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to achieve impressive results in a variety of Atari 2600 games.

## Overview
                                                          
### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

The Deep Q-Network is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that extends Q-learning to handle high-dimensional state spaces. It employs a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which represents the expected cumulative future rewards for taking a specific action in a given state. This allows DQN to learn directly from raw sensory inputs, making it applicable to a wide range of tasks.

### Atari Games

The Atari 2600, a popular home video game console in the late 1970s and early 1980s, featured a diverse collection of games. These games serve as a benchmark for testing the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms. Each game in the Atari 2600 suite provides a unique environment with different challenges, making them an ideal testbed for training agents to generalize across a variety of tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x (3.8)
- PyTorch (1.12.1)
- Gym (OpenAI)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-FDU/DQN-Atari_Games.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt
```

The training script uses the Gymnasium API and requires Stable-Baselines3 2.x Atari wrappers. If `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs `stable-baselines3==1.2.0`, upgrade the runtime dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple "stable_baselines3==2.0.0a1" "gymnasium[atari,accept-rom-license]==0.28.1" "ale-py==0.8.1"
```

Optionally configure the Tsinghua PyPI mirror globally on the cloud machine before installation:

```bash
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

## Play

```bash
python playdemo.py
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the DQN agent, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Set up the required dependencies as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. Train the DQN agent:

```bash
sh train.sh
```  
or
```  
python dqn_atari.py --exp-name MsPacman-v5 --capture-video --save-model --env-id ALE/MsPacman-v5 --total-timesteps 5000000 --buffer-size 400000
```  

If you want to change the game that you train, please edit the game environment name in `train.sh` file.

3. Evaluate the trained agent:

When `--save-model` is enabled, training saves the model under `runs/{run_name}/` and runs evaluation at the end. With `--capture-video`, generated videos are stored under `videos/{run_name}/` and `videos/{run_name}-eval/`.

For a quick local smoke test before cloud training, reduce the step counts:

```bash
python dqn_atari.py --exp-name MsPacman-smoke --capture-video --save-model --env-id ALE/MsPacman-v5 --total-timesteps 1000 --learning-starts 100 --buffer-size 1000
```

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. Preprocess raw game frames to reduce dimensionality.
2. Initialize a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function.
3. Initialize a replay buffer to store experiences.
4. For each episode, perform the following steps:
   - Select an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.
   - Execute the action in the environment and observe the next state, reward, and terminal flag.
   - Store the experience in the replay buffer.
   - Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer and perform a Q-learning update step.
   - Update the target Q-network periodically.

## Evaluation

The evaluation process involves testing the trained DQN agent on a specific game. The agent's performance is measured in terms of the average score achieved over a specified number of episodes.
